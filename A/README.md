- **Availability** is one of the three objectives of Information Security - CIA Model. Availability is an assurance that the data, services, System hardwares or Network resources are accessible whenever needed by authorized users or parties. Backup is the main mitigation followed to ensure Availability. Other methods include Disaster recovery, Redundancy, Failover, Environmental controls, Virtualization and Server clustering.

- **Address** is the value identifying an account in the Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Network. The address is generally computed from hash value of the public key. Bitcoin Address is Base58Check encoded value of Double Hash of Public Key. It is 26-35 alphanumeric long. SHA-256 Hash is used.

- **ASIC** - An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a special circuit solely designed for a particular purpose. ASIC Miners are designed for the purpose of mining a specific Cryptocurrency. Antminer S9 with a hash power of 14.0TH/s is a Bitcoin ASIC Miner.
